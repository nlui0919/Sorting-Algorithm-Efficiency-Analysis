# Sorting-Algorithm-Efficiency-Analysis
The code includes the manually coded bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, merge sort, and heap sort. It runs each test 10,000 times on various types of data, and stores the time it took. It then gives you graphs showing the times of each sort.
